* bfo-ro-background.clif

these are background theorems needed for defining core relations and
classes, but not intended to be used directly in ontology
construction. It also includes the is_a and instance_of relations
which are typically considered as separate from the ontology and part
of the logical language when working with owl or obo.

Examples: exists_at/2

* bfo-taxonomy-src.clif

the core BFO taxonomy (derived from the OWL)

* ro-core-inst-inst-src.clif

the core RO instance-level relations, plus related axioms. Note that
this is the 'source' representation (see ../README)

* ro-core-type-type-src.clif

RO type level relations. These are mostly fairly trivially defined
all-some versions defined in terms of the instance level
relations. They are defined using 'macro-style' atomic sentences which
compile to all-some quantified sentences in ../fol-derived. See
bfo-meta-type-level.clif for details
