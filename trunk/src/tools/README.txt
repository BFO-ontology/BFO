About this directory

Note that the specifications and build-artifacts subdirectories are
soft links to the corresponding directories in ../ontology/owl-group/
If you are on a windows machine this might not work (meaning you will
have to go to the aforementioned directories directly)

Code:

bfo.asd - asdf specification to load the lisp files necessary
bfo2-annotations.lisp - code to process annotations 
extract-reference-annotations.lisp - code to extract annotations from reference doc
generate-bfo2.lisp - turning the spec into OWL
parse-specification.lisp - read the specification
process-axioms.lisp - turn the lisp axioms into owl axioms. Analyze the existing ones.
lib - libraries, such as those needed to parse Word documents.

specification/

  bfo2-reference.lisp - specification of structure of bfo2, class hierarchy, property hierarchy
  bfo2-uris.lisp - URIs, mapping from 1.1 etc
  binary-property-axioms.lisp - axioms for binary relations
  ternary-property-axioms.lisp - axioms for temporalized relations
  non-reference-annotations.lisp - annotations not from the BFO2 reference.

build-artifacts/
  annotations-extracted-from-reference.txt
  raw-schulz-axioms.lisp - The non-annotation axioms extracted from owl-schulz/bfo.owl
  filtered-schulz-axioms.lisp - sorted
   a) to review 
   b) generated by bfo2-reference (not needed) 
   c) axioms that use a term not in the spec (yet?)

From an earlier effort resulting in owl-ruttenberg
bfo1.1/bfo-relations.lisp
bfo1.1/bfo1.1-to-2.lisp

temporalized-relations.lisp - prototype of temporalized relations and
   temporally qualified continuants.
