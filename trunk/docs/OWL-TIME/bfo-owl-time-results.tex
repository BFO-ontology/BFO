\subsection*{OWL models}

According to the specifications two OWL models for BFO were used. 
The first one, implementing the TR (temporalized relations) approach, is a minor update to the BFO2OWL ``Graz'' release (July 2012), with 78 object properties. 
The second one was newly built following the BFO2 specification and extending the set of object properties only by ..., with a total number of 58 object properties.
