\subsection*{Overview}

Our goal here is to find an optimal way to represent, distinctively, the three temporal relatedness patterns TGR, PGR, and PSR in OWL ontologies. 
Two competing approaches are introduced and discussed, \emph{Temporalized Relations} (TR) and \emph{Temporally Qualified Continuants} (TQC). Whereas TR integrates time 
aspects into the definition of OWL object properties, TQC provides a way to model all instantiations of continuant classes as temporal slices of continuants. 
The approach pursued in this paper can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Formulation of examples and competency questions which represent typical representational tasks and reasoning requirements; 
\item
Formalization of the TR approach;
\item 
Formalization of the TQC approach;
\item 
Representation of examples by means of both TR and TQC; 
\item 
Evaluation of TR and TQC inlight of the identified competency questions. 

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Examples and Competency Questions}
 
The following examples (EX) and competency questions (CQ) will be used for the comparison of the two representational approaches. 
%They address  phased sortals, changing location at individual level (iii) class-level queries on anatomical objects (iv) class-level queries in which other than mereological relations occur (e.g. inherence, participation)}
For each temporal kind of relatedness (TGR, PGR, PSR), examples are created according to the following criteria:  
class-level (c), individual-level (i) mereotopological (m+), non-mereotopological (m-), participation (p), 
with quantification over the participant (p1) and over the process (p2).  
In addition we will provide a class-level and an individual-level examples for a non-rigid classes, i.e. OWL classes whose members may not instantiate this class for all of their lifetime, such as \emph{Student} or \emph{Embryo} \cite{OntoClean}. 
For each CQ, its conformance to the corresponding EX is analyzed by the authors and decided of whether it is satisfiable with regard to the premise stated in the corresponding EX. Satisfiability of the example $i$ means that there is at least one truth-making interpretation of the logical theory, consisting of the ontology $O$, together with the example $EX_i$ and the competency querstion $CQ_i$.  \todo{copy the modified wording of the UCs and CQs to the Excel table}

\subsection*{Formalization of both TR and TQR}
Both approaches were expressed in first order logic (FOL). FOL expressions are then 
transformed in a way that essentially preserves the semantics on the basis of the BFO 2 technical specification \cite{BFO2:ref}, but  
use exclusively binary relations. From the resulting formulas, corresponding OWL axioms can then be derived.  

\subsection*{OWL Implementation and evaluation methods}
The TR approach has already been implemented as an OWL ontology \cite{BFO2:Graz}. For this paper we have develop the TQR ontology by 
removing all TR-specific relations 
from the TR ontology and adding 
the additional content required for the TQC solution, using Prot\'eg\'e 4.3. 
These OWL files are then imported into the specific ontologies that 
implement the examples. We then assess the two sets of treatment of these examples in light of the above introduced competency questions formulated as DL queries. 
For each example and either the TR or the TQC ontology we investigate whether (i) the corresponding approach captures the intended semantics, 
(ii) whether it provides a correct answer to the related competency question, (iii) whether the solution is user-friendly, and (iv), whether it has a good computational performance.
