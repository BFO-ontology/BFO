\textbf{Background:}
OWL is a popular ontology development language which is supported by a wide range of tools
such as editors and reasoners. It is increasingly being adopted by large scale biomedical
ontologies such as the Gene Ontology and ChEBI. A limitation of OWL is that it only allows
for the expression of binary relationships (object properties). In the biomedical domain,
much of the knowledge that is represented in ontologies is linked to time in some fashion.
For example, different developmental stages of an organism have different anatomical properties.
Representing this information accurately often requires the use of ternary relations (i.e. with an
additional parameter), not supported in OWL.

\textbf{Results:}
In this paper we present two patterns that address this limitation, emph{viz.} TR 
(temporalized relations), which embeds temporalization into OWL object properties, 
and TQC (temporally qualified continuants), which assumes all continuant instances
to be referred to in the context of a time point or 
interval. 
A series of 23 modelling examples was created, each of which represented a different
type of modelling problems. Each of them was challenged by one formally expressed 
competency question. A comparison to a manually created reference standard yielded
16 of 23 concordances for TQC and 8 of 23 for TR.  

\textbf{Conclusions:}
We found the TQC approach more powerful for addressing modelling problems and
getting the correct entailments. TR offers a more compact representation but
does not allow for explicit time reference for A-Box entities. 
Interaction with user communities and scaling experiments will be necessary to
reach a decision about which should be the appropriate approach to be followed
for an OWL version of BFO.

\section*{Additional Files}
  
  
\subsection*{BFO OWL with temporalized relations}
This file (bfo\_tr.owl) corresponds to ``BFO OWL Graz'' as released in July 2012. It includes temporalized 
relations such as ``has continuant part at all times'', ``inheres in at some time'' etc.

\subsection*{BFO OWL with temporally qualified continuants}
This file (bfo\_tqc.owl)corresponds does not include temporalized relations and strictly follows the relations
as provided by the BFO reference guide. All ternary relations are reduced to binary object properties involving temporally qualified continuants (TQCs).
For the handling of TQCs additional object properties were added, as described in this paper. 

\subsection*{examples for temporalized relations}
This file (bfo\_tr\_uc.owl)contains the examples as described in this paper. 
It imports bfo\_tr.owl.

\subsection*{examples for temporally qualified continuants}
This file (bfo\_tqc\_uc.owl)contains the examples as described in this paper. 
It imports bfo\_tqc.owl.
