EXPERIMENTAL!!!

This directory contains OWL documents that have been generated from
fol-src (see Makefile in the directory above).

Translation from FOL is hard; however, we are translating from mostly
atomic sentences that utilize second-order style predicates defined in
../bfo-meta/

This means we are translating sentences of the form

  (transitive part_of)

Rather than

  (forall (r)
          (iff (transitive r)
               (forall (x y z)
                       (if (and (r x y)
                                (r y z))
                           (r x z)))))

The file ../bfo-meta/bfo-meta-owl-mapping.clif contains translation axioms such as

  (forall (p)
          (iff (transitive p)
               (owl:TransitiveProperty p)))

These axioms are applied directly to generate OWL as atomic CLIF
sentences, in this case:

  (owl:TransitiveProperty part_of)

The Thea2 library is used to generate RDF/XML from these atomic sentences.

There are also some (incomplete) text metadata mapping rules in ../bfo-meta

We do not attempt to translate anything more complex than atomic
sentences. However, this should be sufficient to generate DL for many
purposes. For other purposes the full FOL should be used.

We also apply a simplistic mapping where the temporal arguments in the
bfo-meta theories are ignored.

//

Using this automated procedure it is possible to autogenerate OWL from
the source CLIF. The resulting OWL could be used directly or could be
used to check the manually maintained OWL.
