The 2014-05-03 release of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is identical to the previous release (2012-11-15) except for some minor metadata changes and the addition of a classes-only variant. See the BFO 2 release notes for further information about BFO 2:

BFO Classes Variant

The http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/2014-05-03/classes.owl variant ("bfo_classes.owl") was generated by removing all OWL object properties from http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/2014-05-03/bfo.owl ("bfo.owl"). The bfo_classes.owl variant includes only the class hierarchy and annotations -- there are no object properties or logical axioms that use the object properties. As the logical axioms in the bfo_classes.owl variant are limited to subclass and disjoint assertions they are much weaker than the logical axioms in bfo.owl.
 
If you plan to use the relations that define BFO 2, you should import bfo.owl instead of bfo_classes.owl. To the extent that the relations are used without importing bfo.owl, be mindful that they should be used in a manner consistent with their use in bfo.owl. Otherwise if your ontology is imported by a another ontology that imports bfo.owl there may be inconsistencies.
