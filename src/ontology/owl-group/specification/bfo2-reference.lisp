;;; Introduction:

;;; The strategy is to have this declarative skeleton which is used to
;;; generate the base part of BFO2. To it will be added the automatically
;;; extracted annotations from the reference, via that, the FOL axioms, as
;;; well as hand-crafted axioms in a different file.
;;; There are several tables of information currently

;;; 1) terms: This gives a symbol (syn:handle) for each term, as well
;;; as information about whether the term is a unary predicate (a
;;; class), a binary precitate (non-time-dependent relation) or
;;; temporal predicate (time-dependent relation)

;;; 2) class-hierarchy: Picture of the hierarchy of classes. Process
;;; to generate subclass relations.

;;; 3) binary-relation-hierarchy: Picture of the hierarchy of binary properties. Process
;;; to generate subproperty assertions

;;; 4) temporal-relation-hierarchy: Picture of the hierarchy of temporal properties. Process
;;; to generate subproperty assertions 

;;; 5) URI allocations, mapping, other metadata. specify URIs that
;;; have already been used, both in bfo2 protos and in bfo1. Give
;;; hints for mapping. Associate with issues.

;; define symbol and arity. We'll use the symbols for any
;; explicit assertion or reference from code. These are not
;; labels. Some labels will come from the reference and some from
;; elsewhere
;; syntax: 
;;   '(' class-symbol :unary props* ')' |
;;   '(' relation-symbol (:binary|:temporal) props*  ')'
;;   '(' relation-symbol inverse-symbol ')' ( :binary | :temporal ) props* ')' 

;; we've decided some relations have a default time quant and that some relations we will drop
;; When there is a default the _at, _st suffices get dropped
;; inheres-in and children should be _at and we won't do _st
;; bearer-of and children should be _st and we won't do _at
