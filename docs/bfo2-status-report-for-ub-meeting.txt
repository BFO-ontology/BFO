(Alan Ruttenberg)

- Design 
-- Every OWL Statement has a specified reading in BFO2 Reference
-- OWL reasoning is sound for BFO2, but not complete.
-- As much as possible is generated directly from specification
-- Possibly push back on spec, where necessary
-- Develop a test suite
-- Driven in the immediate term by OBI requirements and developments
-- OWL reasons over individuals

- Implementation 
-- Two :(
-- Alan's in lisp, generates OWL, axioms numbered and commented in the
   ontology. Wants to pull, documentation, examples, notes from
   annotation of BFO2-reference
-- Stefan's manually maintained 

- Organizational
-- Not terribly organized yet on the personel side
-- Online getting organized - http://code.google.com/p/bfo, http://groups.google.com/group/bfo-owl-devel, google docs

- Issues
-- Two and Three arity predicates - Virtually no continuant relations
   can be defined currently. Some alternatives have been proposed, but
   we are blocked on the semantics of rdf:type.
-- How to represent Adult: Adult subclassOf Person, children subclassOf person, adult disjointFrom child bang!
-- Permanent versus generic parthood, temporal illustrative of problems
-- OWL Semantics is agnostic to time. Atemporal assertions OK -
   Occurrents. Makes us lean to saying what we can as occurrent.
-- Inverse relations - when to define
-- label policy
-- OWL/BFO2 issue - instantiation versus existence
-- Part-of or proper-part-of

- History
-- Much discussion and development, as well as prototypes made by
   Chris Mungall and Myself, in consultation with Barry, Robert
   Stevens, Bjoern Peters.
-- Version currently at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl is ruttenberg's
-- Agreement then pullback makes work harder, e.g aggregate-of/fiat-part-of relations
