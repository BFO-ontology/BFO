\subsection*{Overview}
The metholology we pursue in this work serves one major goal, \emph{viz.} to find an optimal way to represent time-related aspects in OWL ontologies. 
It can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Formulation of time-sensitive use cases and competency questions, which represent typical representational tasks and reasoning requirements
\item
Formalization of the first approach (Temporalized Relations), which embeds time aspects into OWL object properties.
\item 
Formalization of the second approach (Temporally Qualified Continuants), which represents time aspects by temporal slices of continuants.  
\end{itemize}
The results will the consist in corresponding OWL models on which the use cases and competency questions will be tested. 


\subsection*{Use Cases and Competency Questions}
 
The following use cases (UC) and competency questions (CQ) will be used for a comparison of the two representational approaches we are proposing. 

%They address  phased sortals, changing location at individual level (iii) class-level queries on anatomical objects (iv) class-level queries in which other than mereological relations occur (e.g. inherence, participation)}





The use cases will be structured as follows: For each temporal mode of existence (STR, PGR, PSR) we will have four use cases: 
class-level (c), individual-level (i) mereologic (m+), non-mereologic (m-), participation (p), with quantification over the participant (p1) and over the process (p2). In addition we will have a class-level and an individual-level use case for a non-rigid class.

For the implementation of the use cases and competency questions as OWL axioms see supplementary data.
 

Development process of gastrulation which starts with one anatomical part and goes on to another anatomical part? See gastrulation wikipedia page. 
I see this part. Which phases/stages could my organism be in?

During neural development the cells are doing something specific. Existence of process defines phase.

\todo[inline, size=\small]{Alan has a worked out example of the phases of life of some moth organism.}
\todo[inline, size=\small]{Embryo has this part but the fetus does not have that part.}
\todo[inline, size=\small]{Joe's income when he was a medical student was lower than his income after he graduated.}
\todo[inline, size=\small]{An assertion about joe as a medical student shouldn't make it on to Joe in general.}

We will use these use cases and competency questions to evaluate two proposed design patterns for temporalization against the following functional criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item technical completeness, 
    \item user friendliness, and
    \item performance profile
\end{enumerate}
The details of how we conducted the evaluation are described in our Methods section.
