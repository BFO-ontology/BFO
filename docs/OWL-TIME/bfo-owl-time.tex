\textbf{Background:}
OWL is a popular ontology development language which is supported by a wide range of tools
such as editors and reasoners. It is increasingly being adopted by large scale biomedical
ontologies such as the Gene Ontology and ChEBI. A limitation of OWL is that it only allows
for the expression of binary relationships (object properties). In the biomedical domain,
much of the knowledge that is represented in ontologies is linked to time in some fashion.
For example, different developmental stages of an organism have different anatomical properties.
Representing this information accurately often requires the use of ternary relations (i.e. with an
additional parameter), not supported in OWL.

\textbf{Results:}
In this paper we present several design patterns for working around this limitation. Firstly, we
describe the use cases motivating the need for an explicit representation of temporality in the context of
OWL and biomedical ontologies. Secondly, we propose and discuss different design patterns and
evaluate them against the given use cases in the context of their completeness, user friendliness, and
performance profile for common reasoning tasks.

\textbf{Conclusions:}
In conclusion, we present our recommendations.
