= Background =

On April 30, 2012, Alan Ruttenberg sent the following [https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/bfo-devel/DoDg9N4Tn6w message]:

Thus far we haven't had any global, agreed-upon method for tracking and then marking as resolved issue related to our effort. As Barry has indicated to me that his work on the first draft of the reference is nearly complete, it is appropriate, now, that we do. 

If you plan to be active in further development of BFO2, please respond, by Monday, May 7, about whether you agree to this plan. Responses indicating disagreement must be accompanied by alternative suggestions on how to track and record resolution of issues.

At that point, if there are only messages in support, and none dissenting, this will be considered policy. If there is a mixture of support/dissent I will send out a doodle poll to have a teleconference to discuss the differences of opinion.  

= Proposal =

I propose that we use the issue tracker on the BFO google code project (http://code.google.com/p/bfo/issues)  to track all issues, which would be marked to indicate they are in one of four categories: 

Reference issues: Issues in either design choices made in the document, including omissions, or more mundane errors of fact, exposition, grammar, or concerns thereof, in the document. 

OWL issues: Issues associated with the OWL rendering of BFO2. Includes issues such as axioms chosen, fidelity to reference, documentation provided, labels, properties, distribution, support related to previous versions.

FOL issues: Issues related to the FOL rendering, including axioms included, fidelity to reference, documentation provided, proofs - manual and automatic.

Process issues: We have hardly any at the moment, including how we decide on a policy such as this. We can bootstrap by agreeing to what I propose here so that at least the construction of the rest of our policy can be recorded by raising issues and recording their resolutions.

I had already created a number of labels to indicate issue status. I now propose that we adopt uniform use of them as policy when submitting (or curating) issues, i.e. that we request that issue submitters tag their issues with one of the following:

 * _Type-BFO2-Reference_ 
 * _Type-BFO2-OWL_       
 * _Type-BFO2-FOL_       
 * _Type-BFO2-Process_   

The templates for issue reports can be customized - see http://code.google.com/p/bfo/issues/entry - most of the fields can have initial values. We would customize the templates to indicate the above.

Proposals for resolution of an issue would be recorded as a comment on the issue, with a status tag: _Proposal-to-resolve_. Issues would be marked as resolved by a comment indicating the resolution adopted, the authority/process by which the issue was decided to be resolved and a summary of changed to documents (ideally diffs). As we currently have no agreed upon process for agreeing that issues are resolved, if we agree on this proposal I will submit that as an issue, we will create a process, and muddle through trying to get as close to consensus on it as we can. 

At the moment, any transactions on the issues list are directed to bfo-discuss@googlegroups.com. During this phase of development I propose we direct transactions to bfo-devel@googlegroups.com. Once this phase of development is complete, we would once again have issue transactions directed to the larger bfo-discuss@googlegroups.com

= Comments =

Please record any comments on the above here, and indicate who you are. Anonymous comments will be removed. If you don't have permission to edit this page, send you comment to bfo-devel@googlegroups.com and they will be added here.

= Record of votes =

You can record your vote, before May 7, by leaving your name followed by "agree", or "disagree". Votes to disagree must be accompanied by an alternative proposal (you can point to another page or comment in -line).
