# Collected notes relating BFO 1.1 to BFO 2

=== Scattered versus connected ===

spatiotemporal region generalizes BFO 1.O by allowing both connected and non-connected spatiotemporal regions

similarly for temporal and spatial region

See http://code.google.com/p/bfo/issues/detail?id=44

=== part_of ===

part_of is no longer in BFO2,  rather we have continuant_part_of, occurrent_part_of, and temporal_part_of (the last is a child of occurrent_part_of)
