== Use of underscores ==

BFO2 developers disagree as to whether relations labels should contain underscores or spaces as word separators, see  http://code.google.com/p/bfo/issues/detail?id=31. It is unclear how to solve this. One proposal is to poll the BFO community, as one argument relies on such a survey dated 2007.
