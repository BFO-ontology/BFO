   * part_of, has_part
   * realizes, realized_by
   * relations to spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal regions.
   * dependecy super-property
   * bounds
  * [Bfo2DeterminableDeterminate Determinable and determinate qualities]
  * [Bfo2DeterminableDeterminate Temporal derivative]
  * [Bfo2DeterminableDeterminate Quantities]
  * [Bfo2DeterminableDeterminate Extended and instantaneous determinate quality instances]
  * Candidates for dropping
   * Subclasses of spatial region
   * Proper parthood.
   * Process (rename !ProcessualEntity->Process).
   * !ProcessualContext
  * Candidates for reorganization
   * Disposition super function, role. Disposition syn: Capability?
   * Object aggregate, fiat object part as defined classes defined with new relations.
  * Rewrite documentation to be usable, correct errors
