This isn't a release. But I need somewhere to keep the frozen version
of what I put at /obo/bfo.owl back in 2010 when there was activity and
demand for some sort of prototype, so here it will be.  The purl
/obo/bfo/2010-05-25/ruttenberg-bfo2.owl is the purl I chose that onts
that used it can (e.g. particular versions of OBI).

What's here:
============

README - this file

Lisp code used to generate these files
======================================

Note, however, that I have hand edited the ontologyIRIs and versionIRIs in this release, so they don't match the code.

bfo-relations.lisp - mapping relations ids from ro to new ids as well as a collection of axioms
bfo1.1-to-2.lisp - mapping ids and labels from 1.1 into the new ids,
		 and apportioning classes into one the components - granularity,
		 regions, classes

Different "slims"
=================

Each of these is intended as a top-level import for BFO. The
ontologyIRI is http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl and the version
IRI is to to the purl that leads here.

ruttenberg-bfo2.owl - what I considered to be a useful subset, adequate for OBI and avoiding controversial aspects of BFO we were working on.
ruttenberg-bfo2-granularity.owl - parts of BFO that were a (IMO) poor implementation of 3-level granularity.
ruttenberg-bfo2-regions.owl - the region terms. There is an ongoing discussion of BFO's treatment of regions as substantial, with Bjoern's opposing (with my sympathies) proposal that we only use relative relations. 
ruttenberg-bfo2-all.owl - everything that was in BFO other than the agreed-upon changes to function, removal of processual entity, etc.

Components mixed and matched into the slims
===========================================
