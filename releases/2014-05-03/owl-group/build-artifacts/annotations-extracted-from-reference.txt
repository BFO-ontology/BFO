immaterial entity - note

In BFO 1.1 the assumption was made that the external surface of a material entity such as a cell could be treated as if it were a boundary in the mathematical sense. The new document propounds the view that when we talk about external surfaces of material objects in this way then we are talking about something fiat. To be dealt with in a future version: fiat boundaries at different levels of granularity.More generally, the focus in discussion of boundaries in BFO 2.0 is now on fiat boundaries, which means: boundaries for which there is no assumption that they coincide with physical discontinuities. The ontology of boundaries becomes more closely allied with the ontology of regions.

s-depends on - note

An entity – for example an act of communication – can s-depends on more than one entity. Complex phenomena for example in the psychological and social realms (such as inferring, commanding and requesting) or in the realm of multi-organismal biological processes (such as infection and resistance), will involve multiple families of dependence relations, involving both continuants and occurrents [1, 4, 28
****************

s-depends on - note

the relation of s-depends on does not in every case require simultaneous existence of its relata. Note the difference between such cases and the cases of universals defined historically referred to above; the act of answering depends existentially on the prior act of questioning; the human being who was baptized or who answered a question does not depend existentially on the prior act of baptism or answering. He would still exist even if these acts had never taken place. A phosphorylated protein molecule might still exist even though it had never been phosphorylated.
****************

material entity - a

Theorem: every entity of which a material entity is part is also a material entity. [021-001
****************

material entity - note

‘Matter’ is intended to encompass both mass and energy (we will address the ontological treatment of portions of energy in a later version of BFO). A portion of matter is anything that includes elementary particles among its proper or improper parts: quarks and leptons, including electrons, as the smallest particles thus far discovered; baryons (including protons and neutrons) at a higher level of granularity; atoms and molecules at still higher levels, forming the cells, organs, organisms and other material entities studied by biologists, the portions of rock studied by geologists, the fossils studied by paleontologists, and so on.
****************

****************

object - note

Each object is such that there are entities of which we can assert unproblematically that they lie in its interior, and other entities of which we can assert unproblematically that they lie in its exterior. This may not be so for entities lying at or near the boundary between the interior and exterior. This means that two objects – for example the two cells depicted in Figure 3 – may be such that there are material entities crossing their boundaries which belong determinately to neither cell. Something similar obtains in certain cases of conjoined twins (see below).

occupies - a

Elucidation: a occupies r. This is a primitive relation between an occurrent and a temporal or spatiotemporal region which it exactly occupies. [082-001
****************

occupies - note

The occupies relation is the counterpart, on the occurrent side, of the relation located_at.
****************

process - a

Definition: p is a process = Def. a is an occurrent that has temporal proper parts and for some time t, a s-depends on some  material entity at t. [083-002
****************

process - as

Examples: the life of an organism\, a process of sleeping\, a process of cell-division, \ a beating of the heart\, a process of meiosis\, the course of a disease\, the flight of a bird\, your process of aging. 
****************

process boundary - a

Definition: p is a process boundary =Def. p is a temporal part of a process &amp;  p has no proper temporal parts. [084-001
****************

process boundary - a

Axiom: Every process boundary occupies zero-dimensional temporal region. [085-001
****************

process boundary - a

Example: the boundary between the 2nd and 3rd year of your life. 
****************

has_participant - a

Elucidation: has_participant is an instance-level relation between a process, a continuant, and a time at which the continuant participates in some way in the occurrent. [086-002
****************

has_participant - a

Domain: process

has_participant - at

Range: independent continuant, specifically dependent continuant, generically dependent continuant
****************

****************

has_participant - a

Axiom: if a has_participant b at t then b is a continuant. [088-001
****************

has_participant - a

Axiom: if a has_participant b at t then b exists at t. [089-001
****************

has_participant - a

Axiom: if a has_participant b at t &amp; b is a specifically dependent continuant, then there is some material entity c, b s-depends on c at t &amp; a s-depends on c at t. [090-002
****************

has_participant - a

Axiom: if a has_participant b at t &amp; b is a generically dependent continuant, then there is some material entity c, b g-depends on c at t &amp; a s-depends on c at t. [091-002
****************

temporal_part_of - a

EXAMPLES: The first quarter of a game of football is a temporal part of the whole game. The process of a footballer’s heart beating once is an occurrent part, but not a temporal part, of the whole game. The process of your heart beating from 4pm to 5pm today is a temporal part of the entire process of your heart beating. The 4th year of your life is a temporal part of your life, as is the process boundary which separates the 3rd and 4th years of your life.

process_profile_of - a

Elucidation: a process_profile_of b holds when a is  process profile&amp; a is a proper continuant_part_of b&amp; a and b occupy the same temporal region [094-002
****************

spatiotemporal region - a

Elucidation: A spatiotemporal region is an occurrent entity that is part of spacetime. [095-001
****************

spatiotemporal region - as

Examples: the spatiotemporal region occupied by a human life\, the spatiotemporal region occupied by the development of a cancer tumor\, the spatiotemporal region occupied by a process of cellular meiosis. 
****************

spatiotemporal region - a

Axiom: All parts of spatiotemporal regions are spatiotemporal regions. [096-001
